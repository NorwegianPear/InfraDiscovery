# InfraDiscovery - Credentials
# This directory stores encrypted credential files for each environment.
# 
# Security Notes:
# - Credentials are encrypted using Windows DPAPI (Data Protection API)
# - Only the Windows user who created the credential file can decrypt it
# - Credentials are tied to the specific computer where they were created
# - Never commit actual credential files to source control
#
# File naming: [EnvironmentName]-admin.xml
#
# Example:
#   CustomerA-admin.xml
#   Production-admin.xml
#   TestLab-admin.xml

# This file can be safely committed to source control
